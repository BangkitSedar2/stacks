# What is Stacks 2.0?
Stacks 2.0 is a new layer-1 blockchain that uses [Proof-of-Transfer (PoX)](https://blockstack.org/pox.pdf) to connect to Bitcoin. Stacks 2.0 enables secure apps and [predictable smart contracts](https://clarity-lang.org)
in the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. Assets and contracts are secured by Bitcoin, and STX holders can earn BTC by participating in consensus. 

# When is Stacks 2.0 mainnet launching? 

Stacks 2.0 is currently [being implemented](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain)
in the Rust language, and the mainnet launch is divided into [five testnet phases](https://www.blockstack.org/testnet).

Stacks 2.0 mainnet is expected to launch in Fall 2020. **There is no exact launch date.** Independent miners will trigger the launch
after the successful completion of all testnet phases. We're currently in the implementation part of Phase 3.

Phase 3 (Krypton) is the most complex phase which implements consensus, mining, and stacking (earning BTC). After Krypton deployment is considered stable, and all issues are resolved, Phase 4 and 5 are mostly about testing.

# OK, so what is the status of Phase 3 (Krypton)?

Phase 3 (Krypton) is currently in the final stages of implementation. Krypton is expected to be deployed in the week of Sep 21, 2020.

You can follow Krypton's progress on [Github here](https://github.com/orgs/blockstack/projects) and on Discord on the [#stacks-core-devs channel](https://stacks.chat).
Here is a screenshot of Krypton status as of Mon Sep 14th:
