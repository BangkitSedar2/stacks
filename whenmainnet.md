TLDR: Krypton Phase 3 [was deployed](https://blog.blockstack.org/krypton-launch-proof-of-transfer-now-implemented-on-the-stacks-2-0-testnet/) on Thur Sep 24, 2020 :rocket::tada: -- Xenon Phase 4 is the last phase and focuses mostly on testing. Stacks 2.0 will launch only when specific criteria (engineering tests) are met. Independent miners will pick the exact launch date after we reach "mainnet readiness" i.e., end of Xenon phase. The estimated launch range is the 6-week window between Nov 1st and Dec 15th. **For any speculation around the date, you should assume the latter date in range i.e., Dec 15th.** We'll notify the community before the code is ready for deployment. Read [this post](https://blog.blockstack.org/when-stacks-2/) about our philosophy of focusing on quality.

# What is Stacks 2.0?
Stacks 2.0 is a new layer-1 blockchain that uses [Proof-of-Transfer (PoX)](https://blockstack.org/pox.pdf) to connect to Bitcoin. Stacks 2.0 brings apps and [predictable smart contracts](https://clarity-lang.org)
to Bitcoin. Assets and contracts are secured by Bitcoin, and STX holders can earn BTC by participating in consensus. See an [earnings calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OJ_pFQ8njpsBPYtWV9bXRx_aJejeXIkQwwiZzuWhvZQ/edit#gid=505229599) and a [community intro video](http://stacks.zone/#IntroVideo)). 

# When is Stacks 2.0 mainnet launching? 

Stacks 2.0 is currently [being implemented](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain)
in the Rust language, and the mainnet launch is divided into [four testnet phases](https://www.blockstack.org/testnet).

It’s natural to want a date to look forward to and we’re always working to improve our ability to make accurate estimations, but we’re much more concerned with ensuring a successful launch.

With Phase 3 (Krypton) going live last week, 90% of the implementation outlined in the whitepapers has been implemented. We won’t rush something out just to hit a date, but rest assured everyone is working extremely hard to make it happen soon. The best engineering estimate is as follows:

a) Stacks 2.0 will certainly not launch before Oct 31st (Xenon will not finish by then).

b) Stacks 2.0 mainnet readiness will likely not go beyond Dec 15th 2020.

This gives an estimated range of 6 weeks (Nov 1st to Dec 15th). Mainnet readiness means that there is a release that can be deployed by miners and it passes all checks. Miners will decide the exact launch date.

**We’ll do our best to give everyone a 2-4 week heads up before the launch is ready to be adopted by independent miners.** The advance notice would give developers, exchanges, and others a chance to potentially integrate before the public launch and give the community time to plan an event around the launch.

# What happens after Krypton?

We're in the home stretch. Xenon the Stacks 2.0 Phase 4 has started! STX miners and stackers will be able to mine and stack on the testnet at this point. Microblocks is one feature that will be implemented in Phase 4 in addition to testing. Here is a status visual from testnet.blockstack.org (as of Fri Sep 25th):

# OK, so what is the status of Phase 4 (Xenon)?

Phase 4 (Xenon) is currently in the beginning stages of implementation.

You can follow Xenon's progress on [Github here](https://github.com/orgs/blockstack/projects) and on Discord on the [#stacks-core-devs channel](https://discord.gg/XYdRyhf).
Here is a screenshot of Xenon's status as of Thur Oct 8th:

Thank you again to all those contributing to Stacks 2.0 and for your patience as we diligently work together toward a quantum leap for the ecosystem.
