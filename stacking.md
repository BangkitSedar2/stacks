## Stacking

Stacks brings apps and smart contracts to Bitcoin. Stacks 2.0 blockchain enables Stacks (STX) holders to participate in consensus and earn Bitcoin (BTC). This process of locking STX to earn BTC rewards from the protocol is called *Stacking*.

Below is an economic model that allows STX holders to estimate potential earnings based on various assumptions and variables, such as participation rate, the number of miners, transaction fees, as well as others. The economic model is based on community feedback and is intended to help STX holders estimate potential scenarios and earnings for participation. For example, assuming a 50% participation rate in the consensus algorithm with 10 miners or pools (along with certain other assumptions, including assumptions related to the price of BTC and STX), the calculator estimates an earning rate of approximately 9%.
