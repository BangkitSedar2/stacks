## Stacking

Stacks brings apps and smart contracts to Bitcoin. Stacks 2.0 blockchain enables Stacks (STX) holders to participate in consensus and earn Bitcoin (BTC). This process of locking STX to earn BTC rewards from the protocol is called *Stacking*. To participate, STX holders lock their STX and publish useful information periodically on the network. The annual earning rate of Bitcoin rewards depends on several factors. For example, if 50% of the liquid supply participates, along with other assumed parameters, then the earning rate can be approx 9%. See details. Users will be able to participate in Stacking via the native Stacks wallet or through official Stacking partners. 


Below is an economic model that allows STX holders to estimate potential earnings based on various assumptions and variables, such as participation rate, the number of miners, transaction fees, as well as others. The economic model is based on community feedback and is intended to help STX holders estimate potential scenarios and earnings for participation. For example, assuming a 50% participation rate in the consensus algorithm with 10 miners or pools (along with certain other assumptions, including assumptions related to the price of BTC and STX), the calculator estimates an earning rate of approximately 9%.

Thresholds to participate natively in Stacking are dynamic based on amount of liquid supply that is participating. More details are available in the [SIP-007](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/blob/master/sip/sip-007-stacking-consensus.md).  

**Stacking thresholds:** 
By end-Jan 2021 approximately 1,006M (1B) liquid STX participation rates are as follows: 
- Assume 25% of liquid supply is participating, the min threshold is 70k STX (~62.5k STX rounded up to the nearest 10,000)
- Assume 50% of liquid supply is participating, the min threshold is 130k STX (~125k STX rounded up to the nearest 10,000)

We anticipate users being able to reap the benefits of Stacking rewards through partners like OkCoin, Staked, and more, even if they themselves donâ€™t individually own the relevant minimum threshold amount.

**Stacks future supply:** 
The Stacks cryptocurrency has a predefined future supply that reaches approximately 1,818M STX by year 2050. See [here](https://github.com/zone117x/stx-supply-schedule/blob/master/supply.csv) for data on STX tokens unlocking by block.
